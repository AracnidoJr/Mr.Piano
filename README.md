This work presents a custom evolutionary algorithm for piano music generation. He  main objective is to develop a system capable of producing music that maintains coherence 
harmonics, rhythmic consistency and dynamic balance, essential aspects for musical quality. In addition, it seeks to incorporate mutation and crossover operations that respect musical principles, 
such as vocal conduction and dynamic expression
